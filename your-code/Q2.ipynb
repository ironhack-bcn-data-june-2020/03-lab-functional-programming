    "Now we want to enhance the `get_bow_from_docs` function so that it will work with HTML webpages. In HTML, there are a lot of messy codes such as HTML tags, Javascripts, [unicodes](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_misc_symbols.asp) that will mess up your bag of words. We need to clean up those junk before generating BoW.\n",

      "Analysis refers to breaking a whole into its separate components for individual examination Data analysis is a process for obtaining raw data and converting it into information useful for decisionmaking by users Data is collected and analyzed to answer questions test hypotheses or disprove theories91293\n",
      "Statistician John Tukey defined data analysis in 1961 as Procedures for analyzing data techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier more precise or more accurate and all the machinery and results of mathematical statistics which apply to analyzing data91393\n",
      "There are several phases that can be distinguished described below The phases are iterative in that feedback from later phases may result in additional work in earlier phases91493\n",
      "\n",
      "Data requirementsedit\n",
      "The data is necessary as inputs to the analysis which is specified based upon the requirements of those directing the analysis or customers who will use the finished product of the analysis The general type of entity upon which the data will be collected is referred to as an experimental unit eg a person or population of people Specific variables regarding a population eg age and income may be specified and obtained  Data may be numerical or categorical ie a text label for numbers91493\n",

      "Data collectionedit\n",
      "Data is collected from a variety of sources The requirements may be communicated by analysts to custodians of the data such as information technology personnel within an organization The data may also be collected from sensors in the environment such as traffic cameras satellites recording devices etc It may also be obtained through interviews  downloads from online sources or reading documentation91493\n",
      "\n",
      "Data processingedit\n",
      "  The phases of the intelligence cycle used to convert raw information into actionable intelligence or knowledge are conceptually similar to the phases in data analysis\n",
      "Data initially obtained must be processed or organised for analysis For instance these may involve placing data into rows and columns in a table format ie structured data for further analysis such as within a spreadsheet or statistical software91493\n",
      "\n",
      "Data cleaningedit\n",
      "Once processed and organised the data may be incomplete contain duplicates or contain errors The need for data cleaning will arise from problems in the way that data is entered and stored Data cleaning is the process of preventing and correcting these errors Common tasks include record matching identifying inaccuracy of data overall quality of existing data91593 deduplication and column segmentation91693 Such data problems can also be identified through a variety of analytical techniques For example with financial information the totals for particular variables may be compared against separately published numbers believed to be reliable91793 Unusual amounts above or below predetermined thresholds may also be reviewed  There are several types of data cleaning that depend on the type of data such as phone numbers email addresses employers etc  Quantitative data methods for outlier detection can be used to get rid of likely incorrectly entered data Textual data spell checkers can be used to lessen the amount of mistyped words but it is harder to tell if the words themselves are correct91893\n",

      "Exploratory data analysisedit\n",
      "Once the data is cleaned it can be analyzed Analysts may apply a variety of techniques referred to as exploratory data analysis to begin understanding the messages contained in the data91993911093 The process of exploration may result in additional data cleaning or additional requests for data so these activities may be iterative in nature Descriptive statistics such as the average or median may be generated to help understand the data Data visualization may also be used to examine the data in graphical format to obtain additional insight regarding the messages within the data91493\n",

      "Modeling and algorithmsedit\n",
      "Mathematical formulas or models called algorithms may be applied to the data to identify relationships among the variables such as correlation or causation In general terms models may be developed to evaluate a particular variable in the data based on other variables in the data with some residual error depending on model accuracy ie Data = Model + Error91293\n",
      "Inferential statistics includes techniques to measure relationships between particular variables  For example regression analysis may be used to model whether a change in advertising independent variable X explains the variation in sales dependent variable Y In mathematical terms Y sales is a function of X advertising It may be described as Y = aX + b + error where the model is designed such that a and b minimize the error when the model predicts Y for a given range of values of X Analysts may attempt to build models that are descriptive of the data to simplify analysis and communicate results91293\n",

      "When determining how to communicate the results the analyst may consider data visualization techniques to help clearly and efficiently communicate the message to the audience Data visualization uses information displays such as tables and charts to help communicate key messages contained in the data Tables are helpful to a user who might lookup specific numbers while charts eg bar charts or line charts may help explain the quantitative messages contained in the data\n",

      "Analysts may use robust statistical measurements to solve certain analytical problems Hypothesis testing is used when a particular hypothesis about the true state of affairs is made by the analyst and data is gathered to determine whether that state of affairs is true or false For example the hypothesis might be that Unemployment has no effect on inflation which relates to an economics concept called the Phillips Curve Hypothesis testing involves considering the likelihood of Type I and type II errors which relate to whether the data supports accepting or rejecting the hypothesis\n",
      "Regression analysis may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable X affects dependent variable Y eg To what extent do changes in the unemployment rate X affect the inflation rate Y This is an attempt to model or fit an equation line or curve to the data such that Y is a function of X\n",
      "Necessary condition analysis NCA may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable X allows variable Y eg To what extent is a certain unemployment rate X necessary for a certain inflation rate Y Whereas multiple regression analysis uses additive logic where each Xvariable can produce the outcome and the Xs can compensate for each other they are sufficient but not necessary necessary condition analysis NCA uses necessity logic where one or more Xvariables allow the outcome to exist but may not produce it they are necessary but not sufficient Each single necessary condition must be present and compensation is not possible\n",

      "\n",
      "Effective analysis requires obtaining relevant facts to answer questions support a conclusion or formal opinion or test hypotheses Facts by definition are irrefutable meaning that any person involved in the analysis should be able to agree upon them For example in August 2010 the Congressional Budget Office CBO estimated that extending the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 for the 2011‚Äì2020 time period would add approximately 33 trillion to the national debt911893 Everyone should be able to agree that indeed this is what CBO reported they can all examine the report This makes it a fact Whether persons agree or disagree with the CBO is their own opinion\n",
      "As another example the auditor of a public company must arrive at a formal opinion on whether financial statements of publicly traded corporations are fairly stated in all material respects This requires extensive analysis of factual data and evidence to support their opinion When making the leap from facts to opinions there is always the possibility that the opinion is erroneous\n",

      "Analysts may be trained specifically to be aware of these biases and how to overcome them In his book Psychology of Intelligence Analysis retired CIA analyst Richards Heuer wrote that analysts should clearly delineate their assumptions and chains of inference and specify the degree and source of the uncertainty involved in the conclusions He emphasized procedures to help surface and debate alternative points of view911993\n",

      "For example whether a number is rising or falling may not be the key factor More important may be the number relative to another number such as the size of government revenue or spending relative to the size of the economy GDP or the amount of cost relative to revenue in corporate financial statements This numerical technique is referred to as normalization91793 or commonsizing There are many such techniques employed by analysts whether adjusting for inflation ie comparing real vs nominal data or considering population increases demographics etc Analysts apply a variety of techniques to address the various quantitative messages described in the section above\n",
      "Analysts may also analyze data under different assumptions or scenarios For example when analysts perform financial statement analysis they will often recast the financial statements under different assumptions to help arrive at an estimate of future cash flow which they then discount to present value based on some interest rate to determine the valuation of the company or its stock  Similarly the CBO analyzes the effects of various policy options on the governments revenue outlays and deficits creating alternative future scenarios for key measures\n",

      "Exploratory data analysis should be interpreted carefully When testing multiple models at once there is a high chance on finding at least one of them to be significant but this can be due to a type 1 error It is important to always adjust the significance level when testing multiple models with for example a Bonferroni correction Also one should not follow up an exploratory analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset An exploratory analysis is used to find ideas for a theory but not to test that theory as well When a model is found exploratory in a dataset then following up that analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset could simply mean that the results of the confirmatory analysis are due to the same type 1 error that resulted in the exploratory model in the first place The confirmatory analysis therefore will not be more informative than the original exploratory analysis913793\n",

      "What is Lorem Ipsum\n",
      "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the 1500s when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book It has survived not only five centuries but also the leap into electronic typesetting remaining essentially unchanged It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do we use it\n",
      "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a moreorless normal distribution of letters as opposed to using Content here content here making it look like readable English Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text and a search for lorem ipsum will uncover many web sites still in their infancy Various versions have evolved over the years sometimes by accident sometimes on purpose injected humour and the like\n",
      "\n",
      "Where does it come from\n",
      "Contrary to popular belief Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC making it over 2000 years old Richard McClintock a Latin professor at HampdenSydney College in Virginia looked up one of the more obscure Latin words consectetur from a Lorem Ipsum passage and going through the cites of the word in classical literature discovered the undoubtable source Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 11032 and 11033 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum The Extremes of Good and Evil by Cicero written in 45 BC This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics very popular during the Renaissance The first line of Lorem Ipsum Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet comes from a line in section 11032The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested Sections 11032 and 11033 from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H Rackham\n",
      "\n",
      "Where can I get some\n",
      "There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available but the majority have suffered alteration in some form by injected humour or randomised words which dont look even slightly believable If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum you need to be sure there isnt anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary making this the first true generator on the Internet It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words combined with a handful of model sentence structures to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition injected humour or noncharacteristic words etc\n",

      "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth the masterbuilder of human happiness No one rejects dislikes or avoids pleasure itself because it is pleasure but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself because it is pain but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure To take a trivial example which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise except to obtain some advantage from it But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure\n",
      "Section 11033 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum written by Cicero in 45 BC\n",
      "At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi id est laborum et dolorum fuga Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio Nam libero tempore cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus omnis voluptas assumenda est omnis dolor repellendus Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat\n",
      "1914 translation by H Rackham\n",
      "On the other hand we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment so blinded by desire that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish In a free hour when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains\n",
